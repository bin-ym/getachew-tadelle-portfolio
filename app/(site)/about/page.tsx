      <div className="space-y-6 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          I am Getachew Tadelle, an Ethiopian artist and filmmaker. My work is
          born from spirituality, cultural identity, and inner consciousness.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was born in Yirgalem, and my artistic journey started in 2002 E.C. 
          I taught myself through observation, practice, and spiritual exploration. 
          My time at St. Arema Gedam shaped my symbolic and contemplative visual language.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years, I expanded into the film industry, working as an artist, 
          storyteller, and creative collaborator across multiple productions. 
          I aim to create works that resonate with both the spirit and the culture.
